        <h1>CS291 - Computer Science II</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Data structuring using structured variables, stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees; recursive procedures; applications to sorting and merging. The class emphasizes theoretical understanding of data structures, their implementation, and the object-oriented viewpoint. Assignments will contain significant programming projects along with programming-free questions that explore how data structures work.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>CS 172, MATH 141 OR MATH 225 </p>
        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <p>At the end of the course, the student should: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Be able to analyze asymptotic running time of a given algorithm.</li>
            <li>Be able to implement and use linear data structures like linked lists, stacks and queues.</li>
            <li>Be able to implement and use search structures and algorithms like binary search.</li>
            <li>Be able to implement and analyze different sorting algorithms.</li>       
        </ol>
